# UKz14

This fork of the CartoCSS stylesheets is optimised for printed UK walking maps at zoom level 14
(scale about 1:12500). They may also work at different zoom levels, but this is not tested.

Significant changes from the standard OSM styling:

The "track" type (brown lines in the standard map) are merged with "service" roads to a narrow
white road with black casing which varies from solid (asphalt surface) to short dash (soft 
surfaces e.g. bare earth), with a "service" road being assumed to be an asphalt surface by default,
while a track is assumed to be a "mid-grade" surface.

The "footway" type is also "disappeared" into either a pedestrian highway (solid surface) or a path
(soft surface, default), again with the goal of providing a visual distinction between hard and soft
surfaces.

Rights of way are indicated by coloured dashed lines, with again the solidity of the line reflecting
the surface, and colours indicating the nature of the right of way. This scheme allows RoW information
to be easily added to "road"-types.

Walking/hiking routes are added.

Many "land cover" symbols have been reworked to be clearer at z14. In particular wetlands have
been rationalised so that an overlay of unbroken blue lines indicates permanently water-logged areas
(unlikely to be passable on foot) from merely "wet" areas, such as bog (overlay with dashed blue
lines). 

A number of symbols have been changed / added to better illustrate relevant features at z14. Features
that have been "promoted" to appear at z14 include tall features, such as power line posts, masts, churches
etc., moorland features that may add navigation, such as sheepfolds, grouse butts, together with
selected "tourism" features, such as cafes, pubs, viewpoints and parking places.

1 km grid-lines for the UK are added from open OS data. The data source has been added to the
external-data.yml config file, and so these are uploaded with a modified version of the
get-external-data.py script.

Contour information is obtained from the freely available OSTerrain50 data set. If the 100 km squares
of interest are unpacked into OSTerrain50/data, these can be uploaded to the database using get-external-data.py
with external-data-contours.yml as the config file. (Loading all the contours for the UK will be extremely slow.)

Data for a legend is contained in UKz14_legend.osm. After adding to the Postgres database, the legend
can be obtained by rendering bounding box \[134.999, -24.998, 135.054, -24.982\] (WGS84 datum).

The rest of this README tracks the original.  

# OpenStreetMap Carto

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/master/preview.png)

These are the CartoCSS map stylesheets for the Standard map layer on [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

The general purpose, the cartographic design goals and guidelines for this style are outlined in [CARTOGRAPHY.md](CARTOGRAPHY.md).

These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed
to be easily customised. They work with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
 and also with the command-line [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) processor.

Since August 2013 these stylesheets have been used on the [OSMF tileservers](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) (tile.openstreetmap.org), and
are updated from each point release. They supersede the previous [XML-based stylesheets](https://github.com/openstreetmap/mapnik-stylesheets).

# Installation

You need a PostGIS database populated with OpenStreetMap data along with auxillary shapefiles.
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

# Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for full details.

# Versioning

This project follows a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning system. In the context of a
cartographic project you can expect the following:

* PATCH: When a patch version is released, there would be no reason not to
  upgrade. PATCH versions contain only bugfixes e.g. stylesheets won't compile,
  features are missing by mistake, etc.
* MINOR: These are routine releases and happen every 2-5 weeks. They will
  contain changes to what's shown on the map, how they appear, new features
  added and old features removed. They may rarely contain changes to assets i.e.
  shapefiles and fonts but will not contain changes that require software or
  database upgrades.
* MAJOR: Any change the requires reloading a database, or upgrading software
  dependencies will trigger a major version change.

# Roadmap

## Initial Release (v1.0.0, December 2012)

This was a full re-implementation of the original OSM style, with only a few bugs discovered later. There's been
no interest in creating further point releases in the v1.x series.

## Mapnik 2 work (v2.x)

The v2.x series initially focused on refactoring the style, both to to fix
glitches and to leverage new features in CartoCSS / Mapnik to simplify the
stylesheets with only small changes to the output, as well as removing 'old-skool'
tagging methods that are now rarely used. It then started adding new features.

## Mapnik and CartoCSS update (v3.x)

The v3.x series was triggered by an update to the required Mapnik and CartoCSS
versions.

Care has been taken to not get too clever with variables and expressions. While
these often make it easier to customise, experience has shown that over-cleverness
(e.g. [interpolated entities](https://github.com/openstreetmap/mapnik-stylesheets/blob/master/inc/settings.xml.inc.template#L16)) can discourage contributions.

## Database schema change (v4.x)

The v4.x series includes [osm2pgsql lua transforms](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#lua-tag-transformations)
and a hstore column with all other tags, allowing use of more OpenStreetMap data. Users need
to reload their databases, v3.x compatibility is not maintained.

## Database schema change (v5.x)

The v5.x series updates Lua tag transforms, linestring and polygon decisions have changed.

There are over [500 open requests](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues), some that have been open for years.
These need reviewing and dividing into obvious fixes, or additional new features
that need some cartographic judgement.
